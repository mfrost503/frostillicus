## Frostillicus

Frostillicus is an IRC bot written in python and was written as a first project for me in python. Plans are to include some functionality for retrieving sports scores/schedules. I'm sure I'll add more features as time goes on, but for now I'm going to work on implementing MLB schedules/results.
